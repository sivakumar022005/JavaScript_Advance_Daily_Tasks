# Task-20: Employee Object

## 📌 Task Description

Create an **Employee Object** using JavaScript and display the employee details dynamically on the webpage using the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.

This task helps to understand how JavaScript **objects** store related information and how object properties can be accessed and displayed using DOM manipulation.

## 👨‍💻 Employee Object

The employee object contains details such as:

* Employee Name
* Employee ID
* Department
* Designation
* Salary

Example:

```javascript
const employee = {
    name: "Sk",
    id: 101,
    department: "IT",
    designation: "Software Developer",
    salary: 50000
};
```

## 💻 JavaScript Concept Used

### Object

An object is used to store multiple related values as **key-value pairs**.

```javascript
const employee = {
    name: "Sk",
    id: 101,
    department: "IT"
};
```

### Accessing Object Properties

```javascript
employee.name
employee.id
employee.department
```

### DOM Manipulation

The employee details are displayed on the webpage using JavaScript DOM methods.

```javascript
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = `
    Name: ${employee.name}
    <br>
    ID: ${employee.id}
    <br>
    Department: ${employee.department}
`;
```
